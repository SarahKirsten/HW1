/*Write a function called ex04 takes no arguments and returns a void. call function in main
in this function:

write code to ask the user for a number between 1 and 10. Loop until the user gives a valid input

use the number in part (a) to output the sum of the cubes from 1 to the number given (by cube, I mean that for a given number x, determinex3)

use a do-while loop to output a number of asterisks, again using the input from (a)

user a for loop to output the even numbers from 0 to 40

implement a separate function that takes an integer, and doubles that integer. call that function from your ex04 function, using the value prompted in (a)

write a function called add that takes two integers, and returns the sim of those integers. call it using two random numbers.

write a function that adds one to its parameter. the function should take the interger as pass by reference.
